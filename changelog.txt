Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2026-02-19
  Features:
    - Underground belt placement for 3x3+ drills (replaces plain belts in the drill body rows)
    - 4-direction belt selector (North, South, East, West) replaces NS/EW radio buttons
    - Beacon fill pass: beacons now fill the entire column/row alongside drills with no gaps
    - Obstacle demolition: trees, rocks, and cliffs in the placement zone are marked for deconstruction
    - Ore-specific filtering: drills skip positions where mining area overlaps a different ore type
  Changes:
    - Removed "Loose" (formerly "Normal") placement mode; only "Productivity" and "Efficient" modes remain
    - Beacons now placed between adjacent drill pair columns (shared beacons) instead of outer edges only
    - Drill pair stride widened when beacons are selected to make room for beacon columns between pairs
    - Ghost placement now force-places by demolishing conflicting entities instead of skipping blocked positions
    - Pole selector restricted to 1x1 poles only (substations and big electric poles removed)
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed underground belt output direction to face opposite of input for proper connectivity
