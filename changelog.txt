Version: 0.9.0
Date: 2026-02-25
  Features:
    - Auto-place foundation tile ghosts (landfill, ice-platform, etc.) under entities on non-buildable tiles like water or frozen ocean
    - Foundation type is detected automatically per planet — landfill on Nauvis, ice-platform on Aquilo, and any modded foundation tiles
    - Substation support: 2x2 electric poles (substations) now available in the pole selector with specialized placement logic
    - Substation placement modes: productive mode for 5x5+ drills uses 2-tile gap with splitters and dual underground belt output lines; productive mode for 3x3-4x4 drills replaces drills with substations at intervals; efficient mode places substations in inter-pair gaps
    - Modded 2x2 substations are auto-discovered and available in the pole selector
    - Substations always placed at both ends of each drill column/row for full power coverage, spaced by wire distance for connectivity
  Changes:
    - Alt-selection (shift-drag) now also removes foundation tile ghosts and splitter ghosts in the selected area
    - Drill selector for fluid-requiring ores (e.g., uranium) now shows all drills except burner mining drill, instead of only drills with fluid input
    - Pole selector now auto-discovers 2x2 electric poles from any mod instead of using a hardcoded name list
    - Electric poles larger than 2x2 (e.g., 3x3 modded substations) are filtered out of the pole selector
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed ore selector showing fluid resources (e.g., crude oil) that are mined by pumpjacks, not mining drills
    - Fixed beacons being placed at positions where they don't affect any drill (e.g., edges of beacon columns/rows)
    - Fixed beacon supply area overlap check using non-strict comparison, causing off-by-one tile error at range boundaries
    - Fixed no drills available for uranium ore when using modded drills that have fluid input
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 2026-02-21
  Changes:
    - Beacon columns now always fill the full column/row regardless of per-drill beacon limits
    - Beacon inter-pair gap sized to exactly match beacon width, ensuring beacons are flush with drills on both sides
    - Polite mode now respects rail ramps and rail supports as ground-level obstacles
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed beacons not filling full column/row due to overly restrictive per-drill cap enforcement
    - Fixed gap between beacons and drills in efficient mode caused by additive spacing calculation
    - Fixed beacons not affecting big drills (5x5) in efficient mode when inter-pair gap exceeded beacon supply range
    - Fixed polite mode placing ghosts over rail ramps and rail supports instead of skipping them
    - Fixed productivity mode not being selected as default for existing saves
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 2026-02-20
  Changes:
    - Pole selector restricted to three specific pole types: small electric pole (wooden), medium electric pole, and Krastorio 2 small iron pole
    - Pole placement now uses fixed spacing pattern aligned with underground belt pairs instead of calculated spacing
    - Poles now placed after each UBO-UBI underground belt pair for consistent power coverage
    - Underground belt direction logic corrected for all four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)
    - Selection tool now has "only-in-cursor" flag to prevent it from entering player inventory
    - Burner mining drill excluded from available drills in the drill selector
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed underground belt input/output types to ensure items move in correct direction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2026-02-20
  Features:
    - Technology-based entity filtering: GUI selectors now only show entities whose recipes have been researched
  Changes:
    - Default placement mode changed from Efficient to Productivity
    - Default drill changed to electric mining drill (when researched)
    - Default electric pole changed to medium electric pole (when researched)
    - Default pipe set to iron pipe
    - Cursor is automatically cleared after using the selection tool
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2026-02-20
  Features:
    - Polite placement mode: optional checkbox that only clears trees and rocks, preserving existing buildings
    - Pipe placement for fluid-requiring resources (e.g., uranium ore with sulfuric acid)
    - Pipe selector in GUI with pipe type and quality selection (shown only for fluid-requiring resources)
  Changes:
    - Elevated rails excluded from demolition in both polite and normal mode
    - Shift-drag ghost removal now also removes pipe and pipe-to-ground ghosts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2026-02-19
  Changes:
    - Change icon and thumbnail
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2026-02-19
  Features:
    - Underground belt placement for 3x3+ drills (replaces plain belts in the drill body rows)
    - 4-direction belt selector (North, South, East, West) replaces NS/EW radio buttons
    - Beacon fill pass: beacons now fill the entire column/row alongside drills with no gaps
    - Obstacle demolition: trees, rocks, and cliffs in the placement zone are marked for deconstruction
    - Ore-specific filtering: drills skip positions where mining area overlaps a different ore type
  Changes:
    - Removed "Loose" (formerly "Normal") placement mode; only "Productivity" and "Efficient" modes remain
    - Beacons now placed between adjacent drill pair columns (shared beacons) instead of outer edges only
    - Drill pair stride widened when beacons are selected to make room for beacon columns between pairs
    - Ghost placement now force-places by demolishing conflicting entities instead of skipping blocked positions
    - Pole selector restricted to 1x1 poles only (substations and big electric poles removed)
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed underground belt output direction to face opposite of input for proper connectivity
