# --- Release lines ----------------------------------------------------------
# This one source tree ships as TWO Mod Portal uploads that differ ONLY in
# info.json's `version` + `factorio_version`. Factorio gates compatibility by
# the minor series, so a 2.0 upload and a 2.1 upload are separate releases even
# though the code is identical.
#
#   PRIMARY (2.1) line -> version + factorio_version come straight from info.json.
#   COMPAT  (2.0) line -> same tree, those two fields overridden to the values below.
#
# Bump the 2.1 line by editing info.json as usual; bump the 2.0 line here.
# `dependencies` is NOT patched per line, so it must stay at `base >= 2.0`:
# raising it would make the compat zip refuse to install on Factorio 2.0.
COMPAT_MOD_VERSION="1.3.4"
COMPAT_FACTORIO_VERSION="2.0"
